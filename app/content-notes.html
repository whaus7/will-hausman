  The past few years I’ve been on a journey of building a business that gives
  back to the planet instead of pillaging. I’ve experimented with many ideas but
  I’m still looking for the right fit. This unexpected journey in my life has
  broadened my skillsets beyond coding which I’m grateful for. I’m hoping to
  come back to my dev roots and find some stability.

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
  I went to school for video game development. As graduation approached I was
  hearing endless negative stories about the industry. I decided to teach myself
  web development instead. I&apos;ve always enjoyed being on the bleeding edge
  of the web to compete with apps. Most of my career has been building out
  features for dashboards.

  This site is an homage to SVG&apos;s and the &lt;canvas /&gt; tag which is two
  things ive always wanted to explore in detail during my dev career.
